# OpenECC

An Open Source Library for Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem (http://openecc.org)

## Introduction

OpenECC is a software package that implements ECC-based protocols for Zigbee Smart Energy 1.x and 1.2 applications. It provides an implicit certificate scheme (ECQV), a key exchange protocol (ECMQV), and a digital signature scheme (ECDSA).

OpenECC is intended for Zigbee platforms based on ARM Cortex-M3 processors. The current version is implemented in C and takes into account both speed and memory optimization techniques. OpenECC supports SECG recommended 163-bit and 233-bit Koblitz curve sect163k1 and sect233k1.
